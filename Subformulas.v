(** SUBFORMULAS **)

(* In [subform F G], the second argument G is a subformula of the first argument F.
This way, [subform F] is the set of the subformulas of F *)

Inductive Subform: formula -> formula -> Prop :=
| SRefl (F:formula): Subform F F
| OpL (F G F':formula)(o:op): Subform F G -> Subform (Op o F' F) G
| OpR (F G F':formula)(o:op): Subform F G -> Subform (Op o F F') G
| SFQuant (F G:formula)(q:quant): Subform F G -> Subform (Quant q F) G
.

Notation "F â§¼ G" := (Subform G F) (at level 100).

Fixpoint subform_b (F G : formula) := 
(F =? G) ||
    match F,G with
    |(Op o F1 F2), G => (subform_b F1 G) || (subform_b F2 G)
    |(Quant q F), G => (subform_b F G)
    | _, _ => false
    end.

  subform_b F F = true.
